        <h3>Chapter 1</h3>

        <p><em>Painful</em></p>
        <p><em>How painful!</em></p>
        <p><em>My head hurts so badly!</em></p>
        <p>A gaudy and dazzling dreamworld filled with murmurs instantly shattered. <br> The sound asleep <abbr title="Our Mc">Zhou Mingrui</abbr> felt an abnormal throbbing pain in his head as though someone had ruthlessy lashed at him a pole again and again. No, it was more like a sharp object pierced right through his temples followed by a twist!</p>
        <p><em>Ouch...</em> in his stupor, Zhou Mingrui attempeted to turn around, look up, and sit up; however, he was compeletly unable to move his limbs as though he had lost control over his body. </p>
        <p><em>From the looks of it, I'm still not awake. I'm still in a dream... Who knows, perhaps the next scene will be of me thingking I'm already, but in fact, am actually still slepping...</em></p>

        <h3>Chapter 2</h3>

        <p>As a history graduate, Klein grasped knowledge of the ancient Feysac language-deemed the origin of all languages in the Northern Continent-as well as the Hermes language which often appeared in ancient mausoleums as well as text regarding sacrificial and praying rituals ...</p>
        <p><em>Hermes languange?</em> Zhou Mingrui's mind stirred as he reached out to rub his throbbing temples.</p>
        <p>He cast his gaze toward the table at the opened notebook. He notice that the text on the yellowed paper turned from strange to alien, before truning from alien to something familiar. It then turned into something readable.</p>
        <p><em>It was text written in Hermes languange!</em></p>
        <p>The dark ink wrote thr following: <blockquote><q>Everyone will die, including me.</q></blockquote> </p>
        <p><em>Hiss!</em> Zhou Mingrui felt inexplicably horrified. He instinctively leaned back in an attempt to widden the distance between him and the notebook, as well as the text on it.</p>
